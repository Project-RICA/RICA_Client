RICA collect comments listed in #Data source.

# Data collecting refusal
In Korea, collecting online data without any personal information is legal.
But if you want to refuse our data collecting, you can request [Data Collecting Refuse Request](Link)

# Method about archiving comment data
First, we assign values(such as happiness, formalness, etc.) to collected comment data.
And use them to train RICA's engines.
After getting used, comment data will be saved without any encryption because we only collect just comment lines.
Saved data will be made public only to contributors and the owner of the site which is the source of comments.
